COVID 19 pandemic is an ongoing pandemic start started around December 2019 and began to spread across the world ever since (Khanna et al., 2020). The disease is contagious and is primarily transmitted through respiratory system (Ciotti et al., 2020). The pandemic had a global impact and all nations, be it developed or developing, was affected by this.

There are two aims to this study. First one is to analyse the relation between the government response based on stringency index with new cases per million in Asian countries. Second is to find a relationship between total deaths and various factors such as Human Development Index (HDI), number of female and male smokers, cardiovascular death rate, hospital beds per thousand, stringency index and population by building a regression model.

The Stringency Index used in this study would be Oxford Stringency Index (SI) (Hale et al., 2021). Stringency Index and other policy measures of different nations had a positive effect in controlling the spread of the pandemic (S. Chen et al., 2021; Furceri et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2021). Study by  Chen et al., (2021) shows that countries such as China initially managed to flatten the covid curve by increasing its stringency index, whereas in Hong Kong, delay in government response resulted in spiking of new cases. The study also highlighted South Koreas high SI with its relatively low number of cases. Furceri et al., (2021) shows that decision by countries such as India, Indonesia, Philippines to reopen their economies before the decline of new cases resulted in spike of COVID cases. These instances show SI is an important factor in reducing the occurrence of new cases.

Studies showed correlation between COVID mortality and social factors such as populations age structure, public healthcare, hospital beds available, smoking habits (Banik et al., 2020; Haldar & Sethi, 2020.) However, poor people in both developing and developed countries suffered the most due to COVID (Banik et al., 2020). A study by Mirahmadizadeh et al., (2022) showed Human Development Index (HDI) has a positive relation with COVID mortality. However, studies show conflicting results also since Haldar and Sethi (2020) shows indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and HDI had no significant relation.

The focus of this study is to do an analysis on Asian countries since they have huge population and many of them are developing nations. How the governments of these nations managed to tackle the pandemic with the resources they had and a huge demographic load would be interesting to analyse. Moreover, the countries had a good availability of data barring a few nations such as North Korea.
